# Important Notes 
Due to CORS restrictions on the provided API, I was unable to make requests directly from localhost.
As a result, wherever API calls would normally be implemented, I have used simulated dummy data instead.
However, I have included an example of a real API call structure on the Search page, demonstrating how the integration would typically work.
